% Definition for the big two line drop cap letter at the beginning of the
% first paragraph of journal papers. The first argument is the first letter
% of the first word, the second argument is the remaining letters of the
% first word which will be rendered in upper case.
% In V1.6 this has been completely rewritten to:
% 
% 1. no longer have problems when the user begins an environment
%    within the paragraph that uses \PARstart.
% 2. auto-detect and use the current font family
% 3. revise handling of the space at the end of the first word so that
%    interword glue will now work as normal.
% 4. produce correctly aligned edges for the (two) indented lines.
